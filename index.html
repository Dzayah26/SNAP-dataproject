  <p>  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP is benefits that people use to purchase food at local grocery stores or bodega's. The program is in place for those who may need extra assistance in buying food for their household. Amounts given to those that qualify for the program can vary on how many are in your household and your yearly/monthly income.
